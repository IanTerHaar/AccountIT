   - Click on File > Open....
   - Navigate to the AccountIT directory that you just cloned and select it.

2. Setting Up the Environment
   - Wait for Gradle Sync: Once the project opens, Android Studio will automatically sync the Gradle files. This may take a few minutes depending on your internet speed and computer performance.

   ```bash
   sdk.dir=/path/to/your/Android/sdk
